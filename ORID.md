O :
This morning we learned the last important part of Spring Boot - Flyway. Flyway is a database migration tool that helps us manage database versions, enabling us to easily perform database structure and data updates. The afternoon's learning content shifted to React, with a particular emphasis on JSX. JSX is a syntax extension that allows us to directly write HTML tags in JavaScript code and can be tightly integrated with React components.
R :
Today's learning content has given me some insights. Due to environmental settings issues this morning, I was unable to participate in Flyway's learning smoothly. I feel a bit regretful because I know this tool is very important in the Spring Boot project, as it can help us manage databases and version control more efficiently. When learning React in the afternoon, although I initially felt a bit difficult, especially in understanding the syntax of JSX and the component-based thinking of React, there was also a strong attraction, especially the flexibility and efficiency of React, which left a deep impression on me.
I :
Flyway's learning has made me realize the undeniable importance of database migration in modern development, especially in the context of multi environment deployment and team collaboration. Flyway can ensure the consistency and controllability of database versions. Although I couldn't fully grasp Flyway today, this tool is undoubtedly a powerful tool for improving work efficiency during the development process. As for learning React, although JSX's syntax may seem very different from traditional JavaScript, it is concise and efficient, which can greatly improve the efficiency of front-end development. React's component-based design philosophy has also made me feel the unique charm of front-end development, and its flexibility and scalability are worth exploring in depth.
D :
In the upcoming learning, I need to address the issue of environment configuration to ensure smooth use of Flyway and further understand and master its usage methods. At the same time, regarding React, I plan to spend more time practicing JSX and deepen my understanding of React component-based development through practical projects, gradually overcoming the difficulties currently encountered and striving to make better progress in front-end development.
